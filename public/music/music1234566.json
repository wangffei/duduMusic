Are we going the same way?\nHey you, hey! Are we sharing the same day?\nOut of the damp and gloomy days\nI sing and dance myself away\nWhile everything falls apart\nI'll arrange another start\nYou brought it up\nThis city reminds me of a poisoned will\nFor excessive redemptions\nThose were the days, I chose to live a life beyond\nThe things that seem to be forever\nIs there no one to share this feeling\nI guess my shadow remain kneeling\n\n","songName":"Babylon Riots","album":"Acedia","singer":"Dark Age","id":1234566}}
